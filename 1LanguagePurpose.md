# Language Purpose
### Topics Discussed
* Why was the language created?
* What problems was the language trying to address?
* Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
### Java
Java was originally was created by James Gosling while working for Sun Microsystems. Its purpose was to introduce a hardware independent language to allow code to be run on any platform. At the time, most code was platform specific and could not be easily shared across systems. To help solve this, Java implemented a virtual machine along with a simplified language syntax to replace C/C++. Java code is compiled into an intermediate known as bytecode and is then interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This activity meant that programmers using Java would only have to write their code once, and it could be used anywhere.

### C#
C# was created at Microsoft and its lead designer was Anders Hejlsberg. It was developed to be a general purpose object oriented language that developers could use to run applications within Microsoft's ".NET" framework. The ".NET" framework is a component of Windows that includes a virtual execution system called "common language runtime" (CLR) and standard code libraries. It is very similar to the Java virtual machine. Although the company would probably not admit it, C# is often considered Microsoft's direct reaction to Java.
