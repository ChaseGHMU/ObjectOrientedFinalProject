For this project, I will be making a comparison of Java and C#. I decided to compare Java and C# because I am going to need to know C# for work at Monsanto over the summer and I wanted to learn it in the context of a language I was confident in.

For ease of use, I pulled code files from their packages so they could be easily linked to. If you want to see full packages, please refer to the two .zip files *CSharpExamples.zip* and *JavaExamples.zip*

Major Takeaways

* Java and C# are incredibly similar
* Delegates are cool
* It is extremely foolish to do a project by yourself
