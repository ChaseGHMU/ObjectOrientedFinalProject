# Unique Features of the Language
## Topics Discussed
* Does the language have any particularly unique features?

### Java
As a language Java is fairly basic. Due to its popularity, many of the best facets of Java get used in other languages. A bonus about Java is that it probably has the largest supporting library of tools and APIs. Perhaps the most unique feature about Java that other languages do not have is the Java Virtual Machine platform itself. The JVM enables any hardware to run a Java program, making Java extremely versatile in the computer industry.

### C#
The most unique features concerning C# are **delegates** and **LINQ**. A **delegate** is a type in C# that can hold method signatures and can be passed as arguments or returned from function calls similar to the way lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes behave in Java. **LINQ** is a C# only query model that works with objects as they interact with XML Documents, SQL databases, ADO.NET Datasets, or .NET collections.
