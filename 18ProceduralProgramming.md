# Procedural programming
### Topics Discussed
* Does the language support procedural programming?

### Background
Procedural programming is a coding paradigm centered around making calls to procedures. Procedural programming can be viewed as a type of programming centered around coding into a series of steps. The objective of procedural programming is to break up programming into variables, data structures, and routine functions.

### Java and C#

I wanted to break from my usual page setup because otherwise I would completely repeat myself here. Both Java and C# support procedural programming. Although procedure is not usually the focus of an object oriented programming language, they are capable of writing in such a way the promotes a procedural behavior. Classes are required in C# and Java, but any class can be written into a  long procedural snippet of code. It just depends on how the class is written. Object oriented programming can almost be viewed as a conglomerate of many small procedural parts. The use of objects does not limit Java or C# from being able to write procedurally.
