# Functional programming
### Topics Discussed
* Does the language support functional programming?

### Background
Functional programming is a programming paradigm based on programming in function expressions and declarations instead of using statements and changing state. Although they are probably not the best at it, Java and C# do support a sort of functional programming.

### Java
Java supports functional programming through the use of lambda expressions and anonymous inner classes. When a variable is able to be assigned to a functional bit of code, such as can happen with lambda expressions, it is following a paradigm of functional programming.

### C#
C# supports functional programming through the use of delegates. The ability of delegates to hold method signatures and to pass functionality as parameters helps C# enter the functional programming paradigm.
